Hi there.
My name is Alexander, I am 32 years old, and I live in Gomel.
I come from a small town of Svetlogorsk.
In 2008, I entered the Belarusian-Russian University in Mogilev at the Faculty of Automotive Mechanics. 
After I received my first higher education, in 2013 I entered the master's program at the same university and successfully defended my master's degree in 2015.	
At the same time, with my studies, I worked on distribution in the Mogilev district executive committee.
After that, I got a job at a Skoda car dealership, where I worked in the car sales department.
In this position, for the first time I felt like a part of an international company and began to develop my soft-skills. 

In 2017, my beloved wife and I moved to Gomel to our new apartment with a beautiful view of the Sozh River.
For some time I worked at the Skoda dealership, but already in Gomel, and later I got a job at one of the world's largest companies, WURTH Group. 
The number of employees at that time was about 80 thousand people.  
Here I gained a lot of experience in sales and interpersonal communication skills.
I have several hobbies. I like spending time  in nature, reading books and running. I started running recently. Last year, I checked in for a half-marathon and  bought a participant's entrance ticket. I had 4 months to prepare for the race. 
My goal was just to run a half-marathon to the finish line, but under the influence of adrenaline, I surpassed the intended result. 
I ran 21 km in 1 hour  and 53 minutes, I could not even dream of such a result. Then I realized that everything is possible - you just need to really want to.

Now about the field of Information technology.
I have always had an interest in 'IT'. 
When I was a student, I helped my classmates with computer science lab work and repaired my friends' laptops in the dorm. 
I took my first serious steps in studying in 2021, I started attending Open IT conferences and even won some merch from Oxagile and LeverX group. 

In the same year I completed the first course in Python programming from the Institute of Bioinformatics, and in 2022 I completed the second course in Python: basics and applications. 
But I had a feeling that I was going in the wrong way. 
And I decided to try other programming languages. 
After Python, I tried C#, but it didn't fit, so to speak. 

After that, I signed up for a JavaScript course from Rolling Scope School, and during the first two weeks of training, I realized that this is what I like. 
I think I liked the fact that I saw the result of my work and was able to show it to others. 
I successfully graduated from Preschool with a small margin of zero point three points from the first place. 
At the moment I am finishing Stage One with the result top one in the score, and I will try to continue to hold this position.
But how did I do that?
Last November, I decided to change my life. I left a reliable place of work, the WURTH group company. 
And now I devote 80 percent of my time to studying at RS school. 
Initially, I made a plan of action for myself and so far I am moving in accordance with this plan. 
My immediate goal is to successfully complete my studies, and my main goal is to get a job in an IT company. 

I will be glad to be on your team and gain knowledge under your guidance.
Thank you for taking the time to watch this video.

Have a nice day!
